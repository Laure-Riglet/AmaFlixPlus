# AmaFlixPlus - A Netflix / Amazon / Canal+ mixing

Work in progress.

The project is a web application that allows users to browse a catalog of movies and series and to order them. The API will be built in PHP with the Symfony framework and will use a MariaDB database. The front end is built with Bulma and Webpack.

## Idea

The idea is to create a backoffice that gather information about a movie or a serie from [The Movie DataBase](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API with its title, then save all of its information to the database with its casting and then display it on the front end. There will be a search bar to find a movie or a serie and a filter to sort them by genre. It will also be possible to see a specific movie or serie page with all of its information and a specific person page with all of his information and the movies and series in the catalog she has played in or directed.

The user will be able to add it to his favorites and to his watchlist.

The user will also be able to add a review and a rating to the movie or serie.
